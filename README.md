# 3D-Animation--1
Creating a simple 3D cube using HTML CSS transforms.  The cube is wrapped inside a container with perspective set to create a 3D effect.  Each face of the cube is represented by a div element with a unique class.  We then apply the appropriate transform styles to position and rotate each face in 3D space.
